                    processing is necessary: [for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for
                    compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims].

                <h5>
                    In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
                    circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you
                    oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you
                    require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have
                    objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been
                    restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only
                    otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
                    for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important
                    public interest.

                <br />
                <h5>
                    You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your
                    particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
                    processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
                    exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
                    by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal data
                    unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
                    interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                    legal claims.

                    interest.
                </h5>

                    before the withdrawal.
